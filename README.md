# Side Scroller

Enables horizontal scrolling by holding down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and spinning the mouse wheel in Visual Studio (2017, 2019 and later).

This feature is available in many other programs. Once you're used to it, it is sorely missed.

# Installation

Install the extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace:
